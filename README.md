This software is used for converting jpg/png images into webp images. It has GUI which makes it easy to navigate. 

- Select the folder where your images are (png/jpg) by clicking on button "Choose".
- This will populate treeview where you will see image name and its extention.
- You can double click on any item in order to open the image in case you don't remember what image it is by name itself.
- When you click on the button "Convert to Webp" you will be offered to select folder where you want your converted images to go (doesn't change original images).
